    abstract = {Automated early process fault detection and prediction remains a challenging problem in industrial processes. Traditionally it has been done by multivariate statistical analysis of sensor readings and, more recently, with the help of machine learning methods. The quality of machine learning models strongly depends on feature engineering, that in turn heavily relies on expertise of the process engineers and model developers. With the recent advent of deep learning neural network methods and abundance of available sensor data, it became possible to develop advanced approaches to early fault detection and prediction that do not require feature engineering and provide more accurate and timely results.},

    abstract = {This paper is to provide practical options for prognostics so that beginners can select appropriate methods for their ﬁelds of application. To achieve this goal, several popular algorithms are ﬁrst reviewed in the data-driven and physics-based prognostics methods. Each algorithm’s attributes and pros and cons are analyzed in terms of model deﬁnition, model parameter estimation and ability to handle noise and bias in data. Fatigue crack growth examples are then used to illustrate the characteristics of different algorithms. In order to suggest a suitable algorithm, several studies are made based on the number of data sets, the level of noise and bias, availability of loading and physical models, and complexity of the damage growth behavior. Based on the study, it is concluded that the Gaussian process is easy and fast to implement, but works well only when the covariance function is properly deﬁned. The neural network has the advantage in the case of large noise and complex models but only with many training data sets. The particle ﬁlter and Bayesian method are superior to the former methods because they are less affected by noise and model complexity, but work only when physical model and loading conditions are available.},

    abstract = {In the era of Industry 4.0, substantial research has been devoted to the field of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD), which plays a critical role in preventive maintenance of large chemical processes. However, the existing studies are primarily focused on few-shot samples of process data and without considering the role of activation functions in temporal diagnostic tasks. In this paper, an end-to-end chemical fault diagnosis framework that combines bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) with attention mechanism is proposed. In the preprocessing stage, a special sliding time window function is developed to integrate multivariate samples containing complex temporal information via operation such as subset extraction. Afterwards, the bidirectional LSTM is constructed to address dynamic and temporal relationship on longer series observation, and the attention mechanism is adopted to highlight key fault features by assigning different attention weights. A case application is performed on the enriched Tennessee Eastman process (TEP), which reduces the bias between sample statistics and larger population parameters compared to existing few-shot sample studies. The metric evaluation experiments for six activations show that the model configured with tanh function can achieve the optimal tradeoff in chemical process tasks, providing a strong benchmark for subsequent fault diagnosis research.},

    abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

    abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

    abstract = {Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series data is an important task in areas ranging from manufacturing processes over finance applications to health care monitoring. An anomaly can indicate important events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker, and is therefore of central interest. Because time series are often large and exhibit complex patterns, data scientists have developed various specialized algorithms for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The number and variety of anomaly detection algorithms has grown significantly in the past and, because many of these solutions have been developed independently and by different research communities, there is no comprehensive study that systematically evaluates and compares the different approaches. For this reason, choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge.This comprehensive, scientific study carefully evaluates most state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms. We collected and re-implemented 71 anomaly detection algorithms from different domains and evaluated them on 976 time series datasets. The algorithms have been selected from different algorithm families and detection approaches to represent the entire spectrum of anomaly detection techniques. In the paper, we provide a concise overview of the techniques and their commonalities; we evaluate their individual strengths and weaknesses and, thereby, consider factors, such as effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. Our experimental results should ease the algorithm selection problem and open up new research directions.},

A multiloop single-input-single-output control architecture is used. The control design approach involves using a combination of steady-state screening tools, followed by dynamic simulation of the most promising candidates. The steady-state tools employed are the relative gain, Niederlinski index, and disturbance analysis. The resulting control system satisfies all of the specifications required for the design. The final {PID} system is appropriate for adding on top of it an advanced strategy for online optimization and it can be used as a basis for assessing the benefits of advanced control.},

The Tennessee Eastman process is moved to three operation modes with 90/10, 50/50 and 10/90 product G/H ratios. The base control system proposed in an earlier paper can properly control the process at all the three operation modes. Optimal averaging level control is added to the base control to improve the control of product flow during random and step feed disturbances. A new implementation of the optimal feedback averaging control algorithms ({McDonald} et al., 1986) is presented in order to deal with random disturbances. Simulation results show that control of product flow rate is significantly improved by using the optimal feedback averaging level control at all three operation modes.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the selection of controlled variables, that is, “what should we control”. The concept of self-optimizing control provides a systematic tool for this, and we show how it can be applied to the Tennessee Eastman process, which has a very large number of candidate variables. In this paper, we present a systematic procedure for reducing the number of alternatives. One step is to eliminate variables that, if they had constant setpoints, would result in large losses or infeasibility when there were disturbances (with the remaining degrees of freedom reoptimized). The following controlled variables are recommended for this process: optimally constrained variables, including reactor level (minimum), reactor pressure (maximum), compressor recycle valve (closed), stripper steam valve (closed), and agitator speed (maximum); and unconstrained variables with good self-optimizing properties, including reactor temperature, composition of C in purge, and recycle flow or compressor work. The feasibility of this choice is confirmed by simulations. A common suggestion is to control the composition of inerts. However, this seems to be a poor choice for this process because disturbances or implementation error can cause infeasibility.},

A subobjective that directly affects profit is to improve the control performance of key economic variables in the plant, particularly the production rate and quality. An optimal control-based approach is proposed to determine a set of dominant measurements and manipulated variables and to structure them to improve control of the production rate and product quality. After the dominant variables are identified, a decentralized control structure is designed to control these variables. Then, a model predictive controller ({MPC}) is built on top of the decentralized control structure. The approach is applied to the Tennessee Eastman Process to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

Instead, many academics in process monitoring perform studies based on data collected from computer simulations of an industrial process.

The control structures are developed in a tiered fashion and without the use of a quantitative steady state or dynamic model of the process. The throughput or production rate manipulator is selected first so that it is located on the major process path. The inventory controls are arranged in an outward direction from this throughput manipulator. The four structures are described and comments are given on their effective handling of the defined disturbances and setpoint changes. One structure provides effective control under all circumstances for 50 hours of process time. The effective dynamic performance of these structures supports the strength of the tiered plant-wide control design methodology used.},
