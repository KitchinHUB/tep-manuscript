\begin{abstract}

The Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) dataset is a standard benchmark for process control and fault diagnosis due to its complex, multivariate dynamics. We evaluate a broad range of machine learning and deep learning methods for multivariate time-series anomaly detection on TEP, covering 17 of its 20 fault types. After preprocessing the 55-variable dataset, we benchmark classical models such as XGBoost and sequence models including LSTM classifiers, LSTM-FCN, a convolutional transformer, and our proposed Transformer-Kalman (TransKal) classifier. We also assess hybrid LSTM and convolutional autoencoder approaches. Supervised models were trained on combined normal and faulty data, while semi-supervised models used only normal data. Finally, we evaluate the models using an independent dataset to assess generalizability. Several models achieved 99\%+ multiclass accuracy, but showed fragility on the independent dataset.
